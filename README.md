## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

1. Python versions 3.7
1. Library and packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, mpl_toolkits.basemap

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Boston Airbnb data from 2019 to explore:

1. The top factors affect the listing price?
2. How does the factors affect the listing price? increase or decrease the price?
3. Can we predict the listing price in Boston? How to select variables?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Data are in the data folder.
There are two notebooks in the folder. 
1. Boston_Airbnb_price_estimator.ipynb, which is the draft notebook;
2. Boston_Airbnb_price_estimator-updated.ipynb, which is the restructured notebook following the CRISP-DM process.

All the functions needed are written in the notebook along with the code.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@zhaoyunma/boston-airbnb-listing-price-estimator-ea34e5370395).
